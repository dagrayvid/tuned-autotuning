summary=Broadly applicable tuning that provides excellent performance across a variety of common server workloads

[sysctl]
# If a workload mostly uses anonymous memory and it hits this limit, the entire
# working set is buffered for I/O, and any more write buffering would require
# swapping, so it's time to throttle writes until I/O can catch up.  Workloads
# that mostly use file mappings may be able to use even higher values.
#
# The generator of dirty data starts writeback at this percentage (system default
# is 20%)
vm.dirty_ratio =  {{ tunables["vm.dirty_ratio"] }}

# Start background writeback (via writeback threads) at this percentage (system
# default is 10%)
vm.dirty_background_ratio = {{ tunables["vm.dirty_background_ratio"] }}
